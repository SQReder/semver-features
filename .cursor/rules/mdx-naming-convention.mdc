# MDX Story Naming Convention

Rules for naming MDX story files in the repository.

<rule>
name: mdx_naming_convention
description: Enforces the correct naming pattern for MDX story files

filters:
  # Match any MDX files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdx$"
  # Match file creation or rename events
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create|file_rename"

actions:
  # Reject files with .stories.mdx pattern
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "\\.stories\\.mdx$"
        message: "MDX story files should use a .mdx extension, not .stories.mdx"

  # Provide guidance for correct naming
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When creating MDX story files:

      ✅ CORRECT: `ComponentName.mdx`
      ❌ INCORRECT: `ComponentName.stories.mdx`

      The .stories suffix is redundant for MDX files and should be omitted.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad file names
      Button.stories.mdx
      Card.stories.mdx
      
      # Good file names
      Button.mdx
      Card.mdx
    output: "Correctly named MDX story files"
