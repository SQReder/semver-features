# SemverFeatures Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers the SemverFeatures class, which serves as the main entry point for the semver-based feature toggles system. SemverFeatures manages feature registration, version comparison, and integration with feature state sources.

## Plan
Testing will focus on ensuring the SemverFeatures class correctly handles all aspects of feature management:
- Constructor validation and initialization
- Feature registration and retrieval
- Feature state reporting
- Integration with feature state sources
- Error handling

## Test Cases

### Constructor and Initialization
- Test that version must be explicitly provided
- Test that version is correctly stored and accessible
- Test that sources are properly initialized when provided
- Test that initialization is skipped for sources without initialize method
- Test proper handling of empty or undefined sources array

### Feature Registration
- Test registering a new feature returns a valid Feature instance
- Test registering with the same name twice returns the same instance
- Test registering with semver strings for version-based features
- Test registering with boolean values for explicitly enabled/disabled features
- Test that registered features preserve their state

### Feature State Reporting
- Test dumpFeatures correctly reports enabled/disabled status
- Test feature state reporting with no registered features
- Test features enabled based on semver comparison (current > required)
- Test features disabled based on semver comparison (current < required)
- Test features explicitly enabled regardless of version
- Test features explicitly disabled regardless of version

### Integration with Feature State Sources
- Test sources are correctly passed to Feature instances
- Test feature state is correctly determined from sources
- Test feature state resolution order (sources first, then version comparison)

### Error Handling
- Test constructor throws appropriate error when version is missing
- Test handling of invalid version formats
- Test handling of malformed feature configurations

## Implementation Notes
- All tests should follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Each test should verify a single behavior
- Mocks should be used for external dependencies like feature state sources
- Console output should be mocked to avoid log pollution during tests
