# React Components Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers the React integration components that provide UI abstraction for feature flags. The components include FeatureToggle, FeatureEnabled, and FeatureDisabled which conditionally render content based on feature state.

## Plan
Testing will focus on ensuring all React components correctly respond to feature states by rendering the appropriate content. We'll test both simple and complex React components as children, as well as edge cases like null rendering.

## Test Cases

### FeatureToggle Component
- Test renders enabled content when feature is enabled
- Test does not render disabled content when feature is enabled
- Test renders disabled content when feature is disabled
- Test does not render enabled content when feature is disabled
- Test renders nothing when disabled content is not provided and feature is disabled
- Test works with complex React components (nested elements, props) as children
- Test with multiple instances in the same render tree
- Test unmounting behavior doesn't cause errors

### FeatureEnabled Component
- Test renders children when feature is enabled
- Test does not render children when feature is disabled
- Test works with complex React components (nested elements, props) as children
- Test with multiple instances in the same render tree
- Test unmounting behavior doesn't cause errors

### FeatureDisabled Component
- Test renders children when feature is disabled
- Test does not render children when feature is enabled
- Test works with complex React components (nested elements, props) as children
- Test with multiple instances in the same render tree
- Test unmounting behavior doesn't cause errors

### Integration Tests
- Test nesting feature components within each other
- Test conditional rendering based on different feature states
- Test performance with many feature components in a single render tree

## Implementation Notes
- All tests should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Each test should test exactly one assertion
- Use descriptive test names with the "should" format
- Mock Feature objects to control the state without external dependencies
- Ensure test isolation by recreating components for each test
- Use React Testing Library for rendering and assertions
