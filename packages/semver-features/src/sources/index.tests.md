# Sources Module Exports Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers the exports from the sources index module, ensuring all feature state sources and related types are correctly exported.

## Plan
Testing will focus on verifying that all source implementations and types are properly exported, allowing them to be imported by consumers of the package.

## Test Cases

### Feature State Sources
- Test that LocalStorageSource is exported
- Test that SessionStorageSource is exported
- Test that UrlParamsSource is exported
- Test that AsyncSource is exported

### Type Exports
- Test that FeatureStateSource interface is exported
- Test that FeatureAvailability type is exported
- Test that source options types are exported

## Implementation Notes
- Tests should verify the public API of the sources module
- Type exports can only be verified structurally at runtime
- Focus on verifying the existence of exported members, not their implementation details
