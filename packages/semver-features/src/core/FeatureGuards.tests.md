# Feature Guards Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers the type guards used with the Feature and FeatureValue classes. These guards allow for precise type narrowing when working with feature-dependent values.

## Plan
Testing will focus on ensuring that the type guards correctly identify the state of FeatureValue instances at runtime, supporting the type narrowing behavior in TypeScript.

## Test Cases

### Type Guard Detection
- Test `isEnabled` correctly identifies EnabledFeatureValue instances
- Test `isEnabled` correctly rejects DisabledFeatureValue instances
- Test `isDisabled` correctly identifies DisabledFeatureValue instances
- Test `isDisabled` correctly rejects EnabledFeatureValue instances

### Type Guard Integration
- Test guards with values from Feature.select()
- Test guards with transformed values (after using map())
- Test guards in conditional expressions

### Runtime Behavior
- Test guards behave correctly with direct class instantiation
- Test performance overhead is minimal
