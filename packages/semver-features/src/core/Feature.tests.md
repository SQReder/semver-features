# Feature Module Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan covers the Feature and FeatureValue classes, which together implement the semver-based feature flag functionality. The Feature class enables/disables features based on version comparison, while FeatureValue handles state-dependent transformations of values.

## Plan
Testing will focus on ensuring both Feature and FeatureValue classes handle all edge cases correctly, including:
- Version comparison logic
- Boolean feature flags
- Multiple feature state sources
- Value selection based on feature state
- Value transformations (map and fold operations)
- Conditional execution

## Test Cases

### Initialization
- Test feature enabled when current version matches required version
- Test feature disabled when current version is lower than required
- Test feature enabled when current version is higher than required
- Test initialization with boolean feature flags (true/false)
- Test feature initialization with multiple sources
- Verify required version is correctly stored

### Version Validation
- Test initialization with invalid version format throws appropriate error
- Test initialization with valid version format doesn't throw

### Feature State Sources
- Test state from sources takes precedence over version comparison
- Test fallback to version comparison when sources don't provide state
- Test sources are checked in order until a defined state is found

### Value Selection (select method)
- Test correct value selection when feature is enabled
- Test correct value selection when feature is disabled
- Test with complex object values for both states

### Value Transformation (map method)
- Test mapping of enabled value
- Test mapping of disabled value
- Test mapping with complex transformation functions

### Value Reduction (fold method)
- Test fold operation on enabled value
- Test fold operation on disabled value
- Test fold with complex reduction functions

### Conditional Execution
- Test execute method with enabled feature
- Test execute method with disabled feature
- Test when method executes callback for enabled feature
- Test when method doesn't execute callback for disabled feature
- Test when method correctly returns callback result
