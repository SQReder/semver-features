# semver-features

A powerful feature toggle library based on semantic versioning.

## What is semver-features?

The `semver-features` library provides a way to manage feature toggles in your application based on semantic versioning. This approach allows you to:

1. Release features gradually based on version numbers
2. Maintain backward compatibility while adding new functionality
3. Test new features in production with specific version targets
4. Simplify feature management across your application

## Core Concepts

### Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) follows the pattern: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** - Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** - Backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH** - Backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Feature Registration

Features are registered with a name and a version requirement:

```js
// Create a feature manager with the current version
const features = new SemverFeatures({ version: '1.2.0' });

// Register a feature that's available since version 1.0.0
const basicFeature = features.register('basic', '1.0.0');

// Register a feature that will be available in version 1.5.0
const futureFeature = features.register('future', '1.5.0');
```

### Feature Usage

Features can be used in various ways:

```js
// Basic checking
if (basicFeature.isEnabled()) {
  // Feature is enabled
}

// Conditional rendering
basicFeature.render({
  enabled: () => <EnabledComponent />,
  disabled: () => <DisabledComponent />
});

// With React components
<FeatureToggle 
  feature={basicFeature}
  enabled={<EnabledComponent />}
  disabled={<DisabledComponent />}
/>
```
